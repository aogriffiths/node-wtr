The [Node Water](https://github.com/aogriffiths/node-wtr) collection.

Water for node.js
=================

A collection of projects that are free, open source, and might help your node.js project grow. 
(Grow in terms of building more features, more quickly, with easier read code that can run 
faster and scale to more users\*.)

\* unsubstantiated but that's the idea anyway ;-)
